# BrainfuckASMTranspiler
This is a fun leisure project.
To be honest, it doesn't have a real practical use.

However, it can be used to transpile plain old 'Brainfuck' into 'NASM assembly' (Linux),
so that it doesn't have to be interpreted no more but rather can run natively because it now is compilable.
